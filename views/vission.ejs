            refers to individuals who have graduated from a particular institution or program. This can include schools,
            colleges, universities, and other educational or professional organizations.

            Alumni often maintain a connection to their alma mater or program, whether through ongoing involvement in
            events and activities, financial contributions, or networking with other graduates. Many institutions have
            dedicated alumni associations or organizations that facilitate these connections and provide resources and
            support to alumni.<br>

            Alumni can play an important role in the success of an institution, as they often serve as ambassadors and
            advocates for their alma mater, helping to recruit new students and support fundraising efforts. In turn,
            institutions may offer benefits and services to alumni, such as access to career services, educational
            opportunities, and social events</p>
